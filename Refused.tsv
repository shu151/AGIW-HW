MSN	m.0198jf	5	Along with [[Windows_95|m.086n_]] 's release , [[Microsoft|m.04sv4]] debuted [[MSN|m.0198jf]] Dial-up , a subscription-based dial-up online service that it later turned into an [[Internet_service_provider|m.0pjxv]] named [[MSN|m.0198jf]] Dial-up .
MSN	m.0198jf	3	The current website and suite of [[Mobile_app|m.0h94y36]] offered by [[MSN|m.0198jf]] was first introduced by [[Microsoft|m.04sv4]] in 2014 as part of a complete redesign and relaunch .
MSN	m.0198jf	3	[[Microsoft|m.04sv4]] 's original news website , msnbc.com  , which launched in 1996 , was also tied closely to the [[Internet|m.03rlt]] Start portal.
MSN	m.0198jf	3	In 1998 , the largely underutilized MSN.com domain name was combined with [[Microsoft|m.04sv4]] [[Internet|m.03rlt]] Start and reinvented as both a web portal and as the brand for a family of sites produced inside [[Microsoft|m.04sv4]] 's Interactive Media Group .
MSN	m.0198jf	2	[[Microsoft|m.04sv4]] said it would be more app-like due to the speed of [[Internet_Explorer_10|m.0gk_qly]] .
MSN	m.0198jf	2	This move was part of [[Microsoft|m.04sv4]] 's strategy to improve its online offerings using the [[Microsoft_Windows|m.04r_8]] brand name .
MSN	m.0198jf	2	The group of [[Windows_Live|m.08nvnv]] services used [[Web_2.0|m.05b058]] technology to offer features and functionality through a web browser that were traditionally only available through dedicated software programs .
MSN	m.0198jf	2	Following the launch of [[Windows_Live|m.08nvnv]] , the [[MSN|m.0198jf]] brand took on a different focus .
MSN	m.0198jf	3	In 2012 , [[Microsoft|m.04sv4]] began to phase out the [[Windows_Live|m.08nvnv]] brand , referring to each service separately by its individual brand name without any [[Windows_8|m.0gvswcc]] prefix or association .
MSN	m.0198jf	2	The new [[MSN|m.0198jf]] portal features a new version of the logo that follows a style similar to other current [[Microsoft|m.04sv4]] products .
MSN	m.0198jf	3	Signing into [[MSN|m.0198jf]] with a [[Microsoft_account|m.068tcp]] allows for personalized content to appear and to be synchronized across devices on the website and in the [[MSN|m.0198jf]] .
MSN	m.0198jf	3	The redesign of the website led to the closure of [[MSN|m.0198jf]] 's longtime personalized home page service My [[MSN|m.0198jf]] ' , which was made up of customized [[RSS_feeds|m.0n5tx]] , as the new website no longer supports user-specified RSS content .

MSN	m.0198jf	4	In addition to these [[Mobile_app|m.0h94y36]] , [[Microsoft|m.04sv4]] develops a [[MSN_China|m.09k4r7l]] specifically for [[MSN_China|m.09k4r7l]] .
MSN	m.0198jf	2	The [[MSN|m.0198jf]] Weather app  shows weather from a user 's current location or any other location worldwide , and it allows users to define their favorite places , which will synchronize back to the web portal and across devices .

Handley_Page	m.01999l	2	With the Second World War looming , [[Handley_Page|m.01999l]] turned back to bomber design and produced the [[Handley_Page_Hampden|m.02rfxn]] , which took part in the first British raid on Berlin .

Chinook_Jargon	m.0198tr	3	Though traditions of speaking [[Jargon|m.0d5rw]] faded away among the non-Native population , some of [[Oregon|m.05kj_]] 's tribal groups continued speaking [[Chinook_Jargon|m.0198tr]] , though usage was diminished .
Chinook_Jargon	m.0198tr	1	However , a strong revival occurred with the [[Confederated_Tribes_of_the_Grand_Ronde_Community_of_Oregon|m.08bwfb]] 's 2012 Chinuk Wawa dictionary .
Chinook_Jargon	m.0198tr	2	[[Nard_Jones|m.02w9hwk]] estimates that in pioneer times there were about 100,000 speakers of [[Chinook_Jargon|m.0198tr]] .
Chinook_Jargon	m.0198tr	3	Most books written in [[English_language|m.02h40lc]] still use the term [[Chinook_Jargon|m.0198tr]] , but some linguists working with the preservation of a creolized form of the language used in [[Grand_Ronde,_Oregon|m.0zfmm]] prefer the term Chinuk Wawa  .
Chinook_Jargon	m.0198tr	1	NB Wawa also means speech or words -- have a wawa means hold a parley even in idiomatic [[English_language|m.02h40lc]] today , and lelang also means the physical bodypart , the tongue .
Chinook_Jargon	m.0198tr	1	The name for the [[Jargon|m.0d5rw]] varied throughout the territory in which it was used .

Chinook_Jargon	m.0198tr	1	Others believe that the [[Jargon|m.0d5rw]] was formed within the great cultural cauldron of the time of Contact , and can not be discussed separately from that context , with an appreciation for the full range of the Jargon-speaking community and its history .
Chinook_Jargon	m.0198tr	4	Many words are still used and enjoyed throughout [[Oregon|m.05kj_]] , [[Washington_(U.S._state)|m.081yw]] , [[British_Columbia|m.015jr]] , and [[Alaska|m.0hjy]] .
Business_rule	m.0198s_	6	[[Business_rule|m.0198s_]] can be expressed using modeling approaches such as [[Unified_Modeling_Language|m.07x3g]] , [[Z_notation|m.089pf]] , [[Business_Process_Execution_Language|m.01xc3f]] , [[Business_Process_Modeling_Notation|m.08kq3d]] , Decision Model and Notation or the [[Semantics_of_Business_Vocabulary_and_Business_Rules|m.03c47cg]]  .
MSN	m.0198jf	2	The company also overhauled its online software and services due to increasing competition from rivals such as [[Yahoo!|m.019rl6]] and [[Google|m.045c7b]] .
MSN	m.0198jf	3	Some other services , such as [[MSN_Direct|m.027mmnd]] , remained a part of the [[MSN|m.0198jf]] family without transitioning to [[Windows_Live|m.08nvnv]] .

War_Measures_Act	m.0199mh	3	Critics , such as [[Laurier_LaPierre|m.07k2pl]] , accused Prime Minister [[Pierre_Trudeau|m.063vn]] 's move to suspend habeas corpus as more of a reaction to the [[Quebec_sovereignty_movement|m.01vb3v]] by criminalizing it .

Isostasy	m.019992	1	Although originally defined in terms of continental crust and mantle , it has subsequently been interpreted in terms of lithosphere and asthenosphere , particularly with respect to oceanic island volcanoes such as the [[Hawaiian_Islands|m.014wxc]] .
Isostasy	m.019992	1	This hypothesis was suggested to explain how large topographic loads such as seamounts  could be compensated by regional rather than local displacement of the lithosphere .
Isostasy	m.019992	2	Conversely , isostatic post-glacial rebound is observed in areas once covered by ice sheets that have now melted , such as around the [[Baltic_Sea|m.01522]] and [[Hudson_Bay|m.0g095]] .
